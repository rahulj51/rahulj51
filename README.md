### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Rahul.

I live in [Berlin, Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin) with my wife Jay. 

In my day job, I work as [Head of Business Intelligence and Analytics Engineering at Beat](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rahul-jain-83055b45/).

I frequently code, sometimes blog and often [tweet](https://twitter.com/rahulj51) about data, software engineering and engineering leadership.

I offer professional consultation and advice on data and analytics engineering related topics at [Office Hours](https://officehours.com/rahul-jain).

I volunteer my time as a career coach and mentor at [The Mentoring Club](https://www.mentoring-club.com/the-mentors/rahul-jain). 

I also offer continued mentoring and regular coaching for a fee (_write to me at [rahul.jain@notjustaboutcode.com](mailto:rahul.jain@notjustaboutcode.com)_)

[This is](https://rahulj51.github.io/assets/resume/rahul-resume.pdf) my professional resume.
